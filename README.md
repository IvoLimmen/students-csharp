# Students

Just a simple application to see how to build something in C#.

## Requirements

* Dot Net SDK 7 (Linux variant)

## Build

```
dotnet build
```

Run it with:

```
./bin/Debug/net7.0/students
```

# Evaluation

I have worked in C# before so it was not a proper evaluation; I used to develop using `mono` under linux. I have to say that installing dotnet on Linux is now super simple.

The good:

  * Modern language with all nice things like OO, functional, etc.
  * Proper documentation.
  * Loads of stuff to find when you need help.

The bad:

  * Wanted to test out DotNet 8 SDK but since that was an RC2 it required an account to use it in Visual Studio Code... that's a nope from me.
  
The ugly:

  * I really don't like the formatter... (as a Java developer)
